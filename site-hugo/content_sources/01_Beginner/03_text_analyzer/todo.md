# Text Analyzer - TODO List

Create a comprehensive text analysis tool with statistics and visualizations!

## Steps

- [ ] **Step 1**: Set up text input area
  - Create multi-line text input with `st.text_area()`
  - Add placeholder text and height configuration

- [ ] **Step 2**: Calculate basic statistics
  - Count characters (with and without spaces)
  - Count words using string methods

- [ ] **Step 3**: Add advanced text statistics
  - Count sentences, vowels, and consonants
  - Use list comprehensions for efficient counting

- [ ] **Step 4**: Display metrics in columns
  - Use `st.metric()` for professional statistics display
  - Organize metrics in columns for better layout

- [ ] **Step 5**: Analyze character frequency
  - Import and use `Counter` from collections
  - Display top 10 most common characters

- [ ] **Step 6**: Visualize with bar chart
  - Create DataFrame from frequency data
  - Display interactive bar chart with `st.bar_chart()`

- [ ] **Step 7**: Add detailed statistics
  - Calculate average word and sentence length
  - Show additional stats in expander
