### Why Performance Matters

Slow applications lead to:
- 😞 Poor user experience
- 🚪 Higher bounce rates
- 💸 Lost revenue
- 😤 User frustration

**Goal**: Fast, responsive apps that scale

### Common Performance Bottlenecks

#### 1. **Expensive Computations**
- Heavy data processing
- Complex calculations
- ML model inference
- Large file operations

#### 2. **Memory Issues**
- Loading too much data at once
- Memory leaks
- Inefficient data structures
- Not freeing resources

#### 3. **Network Latency**
- Slow database queries
- API calls
- Large file downloads
- Multiple round trips

#### 4. **Rendering Problems**
- Displaying too much data
- Complex visualizations
- Frequent reruns
- Inefficient updates

### Optimization Techniques We'll Explore

1. **Caching** - Store results to avoid recomputation
2. **Lazy Loading** - Load data only when needed
3. **Pagination** - Display data in chunks
4. **Column Selection** - Reduce data size
5. **Efficient Data Structures** - Use appropriate types
6. **Batch Processing** - Process data in groups

### Measuring Performance

**Key Metrics:**
- Load time (initial page load)
- Response time (interaction to result)
- Throughput (operations per second)
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization

### What We'll Build

A demonstration of various optimization techniques:
- Before/after comparisons
- Performance measurements
- Best practices
- Real-world examples
