### What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is an automated process that moves data from source to destination, often transforming it along the way.

#### ETL Process

**Extract** → **Transform** → **Load**

- **Extract**: Pull data from sources (databases, APIs, files)
- **Transform**: Clean, validate, and process data
- **Load**: Store processed data in target system

### Common Pipeline Examples

1. **User Data Pipeline**
   - Extract: User activities from app database
   - Transform: Aggregate and anonymize
   - Load: Analytics warehouse

2. **Sales Analytics Pipeline**
   - Extract: Sales transactions
   - Transform: Calculate metrics, join with product data
   - Load: Business intelligence dashboard

3. **Log Processing Pipeline**
   - Extract: Application logs
   - Transform: Parse, filter errors
   - Load: Monitoring system

### Why Monitor Pipelines?

- Track progress and status
- Identify failures quickly
- Optimize performance
- Ensure data quality
- Meet SLAs

### What We'll Build

A dashboard to monitor multiple data pipelines with:
- Real-time status tracking
- Progress indicators
- Performance metrics
- Historical trends
- Error logging
