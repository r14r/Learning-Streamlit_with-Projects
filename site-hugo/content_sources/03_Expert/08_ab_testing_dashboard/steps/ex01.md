### What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing (split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of something to determine which performs better.

#### How it Works

1. **Split traffic**: Divide users into two groups
   - **Group A (Control)**: Sees original version
   - **Group B (Variant)**: Sees modified version

2. **Measure results**: Track conversion rates for each group

3. **Statistical analysis**: Determine if the difference is significant

#### Common Use Cases

- **Website design**: Test different layouts, colors, or CTAs
- **Email marketing**: Compare subject lines or content
- **Product features**: Evaluate new functionality
- **Pricing**: Test different price points
- **User experience**: Optimize flows and interactions

### Key Metrics

**Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users who complete desired action
```
Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Visitors) × 100%
```

**Statistical Significance**: Probability that results aren't due to chance
- Typically want p-value < 0.05 (95% confidence)
- Means less than 5% chance results are random

### Example Scenario

**Testing a "Buy Now" button color:**
- **Group A**: 10,000 visitors, 1,200 conversions (12% rate)
- **Group B**: 10,000 visitors, 1,500 conversions (15% rate)
- **Improvement**: 25% increase in conversions
- **Question**: Is this statistically significant?

### What We'll Build

A complete A/B testing dashboard with:
- Input controls for test data
- Conversion rate calculations
- Statistical significance testing
- Visual comparisons
- Actionable insights
