Step 1: Basic CSV File Upload

In this first step, we'll:
- Set up the page configuration
- Add a file uploader for CSV files
- Display a message when no file is uploaded

Key Concepts:
- st.file_uploader() for file uploads
- Specifying file types with the 'type' parameter
- Conditional rendering based on file upload state

st.write("Upload and analyze your CSV files")

# File uploader
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", type=['csv'])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    st.success(f"✅ Successfully loaded: {uploaded_file.name}")

    # We'll add data reading in the next step
    st.info("Data reading will be added in the next step")
